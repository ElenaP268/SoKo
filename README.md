# So Korean (SoKo)
SoKo is a website to introduce beginner-level learners to the Korean language through a curriculum on grammar and syntax rules paired with its historical and cultural significance. The website includes embedded presentations, short quizzes, and a translator/vocabulary builder using an API. 
This is a personal project created by Elena Paul, Susie Lee, and Nicole Bain during high school at Allen High School.
